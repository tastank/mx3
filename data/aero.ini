; TODO according to ecomodder.com, the Cd is 0.32. The LUT has the 0deg Cd at 0.41, which may give about the right results with the span and chord both set to 1m as they are here, but I should probably set the Cd appropriately and adjust the span and chord to the width and length of the car, respectively
[WING_0]								; Wing identifier. A car can have as many wings as necessary.
NAME=BODY								; name of the wing
CHORD=1									; length of the wing in meters
SPAN=1.0								; width of the wing in meters. both help determine the frontal area of the wing. Single unit is used to simplify calculations
